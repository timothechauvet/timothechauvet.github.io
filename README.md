A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website for my personal visit card and blog. 

**It is accessible from the following URL : [timothechau.vet](https://timothechau.vet)**

## Toha theme
My website is using the [Toha theme](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha). It was made possible thanks to all of its [contributors](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha/graphs/contributors). 

The theme is registered under the [MIT License](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha/blob/main/LICENSE)

For more details about the features please visit [here](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/features/).

## GoatCounter metrics

My website is using [arp242's GoatCounter](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter) for the metrics. All metrics are publicly available from the following URL : [stats.timothechau.vet](https://stats.timothechau.vet/). 

As GoatCounter is engineered around non-identifiable metrics of visitors, it *probably* doesn't apply to the GDPR legislation which doesn't concern :
>anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.

More information [on that page](https://stats.timothechau.vet/help/gdpr).

The tool is registered under a custom version of the [EUPL 1.2 license](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter/blob/master/LICENSE).
