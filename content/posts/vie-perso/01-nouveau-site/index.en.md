After two weeks of hard work, teaching myself the fundamentals of the **[Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme** working with the **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework**, I'm very happy to to launch my super personal blog on which I'm writing these lines. I use the services of **GitHub** to host my site and the superpowers of **GitHub Actions** to generate the static content of my site. Feel free to give me feedback on my site ðŸ‘‹
